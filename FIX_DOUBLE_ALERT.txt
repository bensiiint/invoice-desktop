To fix the double PDF success message:

In PrintPreviewModal.js, find this line (around line 1023):
        alert('PDF saved successfully!');

And replace it with:
        // Success message is shown by Electron backend

This will remove the duplicate alert since the Electron backend already shows a success message when saving the PDF.
