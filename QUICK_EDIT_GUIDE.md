# Quick Edit Feature - Implementation Complete! 🎉

## What We Built:

A **Quick Edit Modal** that allows you to edit quotation values directly from the Print Preview screen.

## How to Use:

### Step 1: Open Print Preview
1. Fill out your quotation form as usual
2. Click the **"Print"** button (printer icon in top navigation)
3. The Print Preview modal opens

### Step 2: Click "Quick Edit"
- In the Print Preview modal header, you'll see a new button: **"Quick Edit"**
- Click it to open the editor

### Step 3: Edit Your Values
You can now edit:
- ✏️ **Reference Numbers** - Change any reference number
- ✏️ **Descriptions** - Modify task descriptions
- ✏️ **Type** - Switch between 2D/3D
- ✏️ **Prices** - Directly change the price for any task

### Step 4: See Real-Time Updates
- As you edit prices, the **Total** updates automatically
- **Overhead** recalculates based on the new subtotal
- **Grand Total** reflects all changes

### Step 5: Apply or Reset
- **Apply Changes** - Updates the preview with your edits
- **Reset** - Reverts back to original values
- **Close** (X button) - Closes without applying

### Step 6: Export
- After applying changes, your **PDF export** will include the edited values
- The preview updates immediately to show your changes

## Features:

✅ **Edit directly from preview** - No need to go back to the main form
✅ **Real-time calculation** - Totals update as you type
✅ **Individual price control** - Override any calculated price
✅ **Reset per task** - Small refresh icon to reset individual prices
✅ **Clean interface** - Simple table layout for quick edits
✅ **Non-destructive** - Original data preserved until you apply

## Technical Details:

- Quick Edit works with **local state** in the PrintPreviewModal
- Changes apply immediately to the preview
- PDF/Print will use the edited values
- Original form data remains unchanged (unless you save)

## Workflow Example:

1. Create quotation → Click Print Preview
2. Notice a price needs adjustment
3. Click "Quick Edit" → Change price from ¥50,000 to ¥45,000
4. See total update from ¥88,000 to ¥83,000
5. Click "Apply Changes"
6. Preview updates with new values
7. Click "Download PDF" → Get PDF with adjusted prices

## Next Steps:

The feature is fully implemented and ready to use. Just restart your app and try it out!

If you want to **save these edited values back to the main form**, let me know and I can add that functionality.
